## Lost Found

this is a simple platform from Laravel framework of PHP what will publish lost id cards that people usually forget at the banks, at the border and any other places the project has 2 parts:

- viewer part: where the lost id cards will be listed.
- admin part: where admin will be adding the lost id card and update their status once owners have collected.

The choice of Laravel is because it is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Why i chose Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
